# DisscoBought
A Discord bot that plays music, based on the Computeshorts tutorial. Name chosen because its more popular homophone is already the name of a popular bot.

## Disclaimer
This bot is not for commercial purposes and was built only for my own educational purposes.

## Commands
/help - displays all the available commands

/play <keywords> - plays the selected song from YouTube

/pause - pauses the current song being played

/resume - resumes playing the current song

/skip - skips the currently played song

/clear - stops the current song and clears the queue

/queue - displays all the songs currently in the queue

/leave - kicks the bot from the voice channel

## Process
### Aim
To understand the process of creating a Discord bot and to be more familiar with Python classes.
### Outcome
I initally had trouble with setting up the bot token, but eventually resolved the issue. The rest of the project was straightforward and easy-to-follow.

## Future Goals
I'd like to create my own bot from scratch in the future now that I understand the tools needed for one.
